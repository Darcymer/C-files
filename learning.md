# Overview

This is a file to showcase things that i have learned about C# and how each area of C# works for me. I made 3 files for C#, one to learn the basic syntax, one to learn about loops, and examples of how loops work in C#.The Purpose of this code is to demonstrate my ability to break down code and explain it to myself and others that read it.

* Make a Markdown for each file to organize my code better and having it look more presentable.
