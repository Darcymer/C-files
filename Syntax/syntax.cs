//Welcome to the syntax tutorial. In this tutorial, we will explain the basic syntax of C#. 
//Please read the comments to see how the syntax works.


using System; 
//this will always appear before the namespace of our code. We are "using" the "Systems" found in the C# systems namespace.

namespace functions 
// the "namespace" is used to organize and call out the classes inside of it globally. It holds your classes 
{
    class functions 
    // this holds how our code will work. This allows for the data and methods to be able to function in our code. 
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        /*  so this has alot of things to say here but in summary its the main method (Everything inside will run)
            -static means that the Main method can be called without calling an object for it
            -void means that the main will not return anything
            -Main() is just the name of the method
            -String []args is a bit complicated but it reruns whatever in mai as arguments that, if passes, will allow for it to display

        {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
                Console.Write("Hello Again World!"); 
                Console.Write("Goodbye World!");
                /*
                Console is a class inside the system,
                -Writeline does exactly what it says, it writes whatever is inside the () in a new line
                -Write is the same as WriteLine but, it does not set the code into a new line
                Please note theat we use the semicolon(;) in this language to break up our code funtionality.
